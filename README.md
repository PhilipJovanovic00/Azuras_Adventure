This is a little 2D RPG game I am creating with Java. It is my first 2D Game, so i am not really good at it. Nonetheless i wanted
to challenge myself and try to make something as complex as a Game in Java, because i always liked the idea of creating
a game by myself.

V1.1: You are able to move the Player across the world.
V1.2: There is Collision detection, so you cannot go where you are not supposed to.
V1.3: Objects have been added, you can now see Objects.
V1.4: You Can now interact with Objects and pick them up, as well as open doors with keys.
V1.5: Sounds have been added, when interacting with Objects. Music has been added aswell.
